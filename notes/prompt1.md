This is a project to do analzye and ask questions about RWE (Real World Evidence), and do things like virtual cohort 
aggregation. Will involve harmonization across data sources. We will be asking questions at the indivdiual and 
population level. There will be several different categories of questions, but right now we are primarily focusing on 
clinical questions and analysis. 

I want to start off by doing some research. We will compile some documentation for each of these sources, which will 
include:
- what kind of data does the source have
- how to acquire the data?
  - web api?
  - ftp?
  - other?
- is a cost / subscription required?
- what does the downloaded data source look like? in terms of files, tables, fields, etc.

The data sources:
- ClinGen
- ClinVar
- cBioPortal
- COSMIC
- TCGA
- GenCC
- OncoKB

Start by creating a document called notes/docs-start.md. Write all your thoughts about what you will need to do to 
accomplish this. This should include a list of tasks to do for each data source. Then, create a list with checkboxes for
each of these data sources, such that you can check it off when documentation for the data source is complete. You may 
also want several checkboxes under each data sources if you think it worth tracking todo's at this level of granularity.

If you have questions for me, add them to notes/docs-start-questions.md.
