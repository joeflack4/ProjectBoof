# Phase 2 of data source docs
1. Docs detail: move from "Moderate detail (major tables/files and their key fields)" to: "Comprehensive detail (all fields with descriptions)"
2. **Harmonization Notes**: Should I include preliminary thoughts on how these data sources might be harmonized with 
each other (common fields, overlapping data, etc.), or save that for a later phase?
