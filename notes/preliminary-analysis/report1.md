# Preliminary Analysis Output Status Report

## Empty Directories: cross-source/ and reports/

### Current Status
Both `output/preliminary-analysis/cross-source/` and `output/preliminary-analysis/reports/` directories are **empty**.

### Reason
The work to generate these outputs **has not been implemented yet**. Specifically:

1. **cross-source/**: The cross-source analysis functionality exists in `analysis/core/cross_source.py`, but it has never been integrated into the CLI workflow or makefile. The Phase 4 implementation created the analysis functions but did not create a CLI command or makefile target to actually run the cross-source analysis and generate output files.

2. **reports/**: The aggregated reporting functionality (e.g., data dictionaries across all sources, cross-source summary reports) was planned but not implemented. The current implementation only generates per-file reports (JSON, Markdown, visualizations) in the `sources/` directory, but does not create aggregated reports in the `reports/` directory.

### What Needs to Happen

#### For cross-source/:
- Add a CLI command (e.g., `python3 analysis/cli.py cross-source`) that:
  - Loads all analysis JSON files from `output/preliminary-analysis/sources/`
  - Calls `analyze_cross_source()` from `analysis/core/cross_source.py`
  - Generates output files in `output/preliminary-analysis/cross-source/`:
    - `entity-overlaps.json` - Gene/disease/variant overlaps between sources
    - `field-mappings.json` - Suggested field mappings across sources
    - `identifier-coverage.json` - Coverage matrix of identifier types
    - `cross-source-summary.md` - Human-readable summary report

- Update `make analyze-phase4` to run this command

#### For reports/:
- Implement aggregated reporting that creates:
  - `files-metadata-json-by-source.tsv` - Metadata for all JSON files analyzed
  - `files-metadata-tabular-by-source.tsv` - Metadata for all tabular files analyzed
  - `files-metadata-other-by-source.tsv` - Metadata for other file types
  - `files-data-tabular-by-source.tsv` - Field-level statistics for tabular files
  - `files-data-json-by-source.tsv` - Field-level statistics for JSON files
  - `unable-to-analyze.tsv` - Files that could not be analyzed
  - Cross-source summary reports

- Update `make analyze-phase5` or create `make generate-reports` to run this

### Next Steps
Implement the missing CLI commands and reporting functionality to populate these directories when `make preliminary-analysis` is run.
